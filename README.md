# My Three MERN App - quiz-builder-app 

# Introduction

This repository is following the below tutorial to develop a MERN application and it can be find [here](https://medium.com/@samarony.barros/how-to-create-your-first-mern-mongodb-express-js-react-js-and-node-js-stack-7e8b20463e66)

## What I did

If your following the tutorial above it will walk you through creating a simple MERN movie application. As a part of my learning journey I have found its alway better to follow tutorials while doing and making changes. In my case i creating a Quiz-Builder App that allows the users to build short quiz about random things.

### Future Features
I plan on adding the following features to contiune the learning:

- Base Functional:
    - Add Quizzies
    - Add Questions for the Quiz's
    - Add Scoring requirements for the Quizzies
    - Preview Quize
    - Export Quiz's as Mark (html, export, etc.)

## What you should install?

For this project, I decided to use the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) technology.

-   [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) 16.5.0+
-   [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) 11.4.0+ (It's recommended to use 10.15.1 LTS)

## Download

You can download the folder on my [GitHub](https://github.com/estand25/) or you can do this directly on [this link](https://github.com/estand25/quiz-builder).

If you have git installed on your PC, you just need do as follow:

```
